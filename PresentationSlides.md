Question 1
====================


Calculate the certainty equivalent of the prospect (0.2, €40; 0.6, €50; 0.2, €30), under: 

Part A
----------------

Expected utility theory with the utility function: 
$u(x) = \frac{x}{10}$ with total wealth = 0.

EV=	0.2	x $\frac{40}{10}$ +	0.6	x $\frac{50}{10}$ + 0.2 x $\frac{30}{10}$ =	4.4

CE:	$\frac{m}{10}$ = 4.4 $\rightarrow$ m=44 
The	certainty equivalent is	44
	

Part B
--------------------	
Rank dependent utility with the utility function:
$u(x) = \frac{x}{10}$ and $w(p) = p^{2}$
	 with total wealth = 0.}     


Probability	of	outcome	q	or	better:

q=40,	p=(0.2)	 +	(0.6)	=	0.8  
q=50,	p=(0.6)  
q=30,	p=(0.2)	 +	(0.6)	+ (0.2)	=	1  

-------

Probability	outcome	is	strictly	better	than q:

q=40,	p=0.6  
q=50,	p=0  
q=30,	p=(0.2)	+	(0.6)	=	0.8

$w(p)=p^2$  
w(0.8)	-	 w(0.6)	=	$(0.8)^2$ - $(0.6)^2$=	0.28  
w(0.6)	-	 w(0.0)	=	$(0.0)^2$ - $(0.0)^2$=	0.36  
w(1)	-	 w(0.8)	=	$(1)^2$ - $(0.8)^2$ =	0.36  


-----------------

Expected	utility	using	these	updated	probability	weights	is:

EU	=	0.28	x	$\frac{40}{10}$	 +	0.36 x	$\frac{50}{10}$	+	0.36 x $\frac{30}{10}$	=	4

CE:	$\frac{m}{10}$	=	4 $\rightarrow$ m	=	40
The	certainty	equivalent	is	40.

Question 2
===========


Consider the prospects A = (1, €3000), B = (0.8, €4000; 0.2, €0), (0.25, €3000; 0.75, €0), and D = (0.2, €4000; 0.8, €0). 
	  
It has been found (e.g., Starmer, 2000, Journal of Economic Literature) that most people prefer prospect A over prospect B and prospect D over prospect C. 
	  
Part A
---------- 
	  
 Show that this choice pattern violates Expected Utility theory.
 Under expected utility, preferences for prospect A implies: 
 
 u(3000) $>$ 0.8 u(4000) + 0.2 u(0)
 
 $\frac{1}{4}$(u(3000) $>$ 0.8 u(4000) + 0.2 u(0))
 $\rightarrow$ 0.25 u(3000) $>$ 0.2 u (4000) + 0.05 u(0)
    +0.75 u(0)
    
 $\rightarrow$ 0.25 u(3000)+ 0.75 u(0) $>$ 0.2 u(4000)+ 0.8 u (4000)
 
--------
 
 Preferring prospect D to C implies: 
 
 0.2u(4000) + 0.8 u(0) $>$ 0.25u(3000) +0.75u(0)
  
 Therefore, under prospect theory an individual cannot prefer A to B and D to C. 

Part B
------- 
Show that Disappointment theory as presented and parameterized on the slides
(i.e., with u(x) = x and θ = 0.0002) can accommodate the observed choice pattern.)
  
  
  
  EV(A) = 3000		D(A) = 3000		
  
  EV(B) = EU = 3200
  
  D(B)=0.8(4000+0.0002x$(4000-3200)^2$ + 0.2(0-0.0002x$(0-3200)^2$)=2892.8
  
  Hence, D(A) $>$ D(B)

-------

EV(C) = EU = 750

D(C)=0.25(3000+0.0002x$(3000-750)^2$) + 0.75(0-0.0002x$(0-750)^2$)=918.75

EV(D) = EU = 800

D(D)=0.2(4000+0.0002x$(4000-800)^2$) + 0.8(0-0.0002x$(0-800)^2$)=1107.2

  Hence, D(D) $>$ D(C)

Part C
------
  
Show that Cumulative Prospect Theory can accommodate the choice pattern.    
Using the parametrization by Tversky and Kahnemann:

CPT(A)

|   x  | p |       π       | u(x) = U(x) |  πU(x) |
|:----:|---|:-------------:|:-----------:|:------:|
| 3000 | 1 | w+(1)-w+(0)=1 |    1147.8   | 1147.8 |

CPT(B)

| 4000  | 0.8  |  w+(0.8)-w+(0.2)=0.607  |    63.245   | 1478.47 |

CPT(C)


|  x    |   p  |             π           |     u(x)    |  πU(x)  |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
| 3000  | 0.25 | w+(0.25)-w+(0)= 0.2707  |   1147.8    |  333.67 |


-------

CPT(D)

|   x  | p     |           π          | u(x) = U(x) |  πU(x) |
|:----:|-------|:--------------------:|:-----------:|:------:|
| 4000 | 10.20 | w+(0.20)-w+(0)=0.261 |    1478.8   | 385.53 |


$\rightarrow$ CPT(A) $>$ CPT(B)  

 $\rightarrow$  CPT(D) $>$ CPT(C)

Question 3
========

 Assume Cumulative Prospect Theory as defined and parameterized by Tversky and Kahneman (1992) (see lecture slides). Calculate the certainty equivalents and risk premia of the following prospects:  

Part A  
------
  
(0.25, €75; 0.25, €50; 0.25, €25; 0.25, €0)} 


|  x |   p  |             π             | u(x) = U(x) |  πU(x) |
|:--:|:----:|:-------------------------:|:-----------:|:------:|
| 75 | 0.25 |   w+(0.25)-w+(0)=0.29074  |    44.674   | 12.989 |
| 50 | 0.25 | w+(0.50)-w+(0.25)=0.12990 |    31.268   |  4.062 |
| 25 | 0.25 | w+(0.75)-w+(0.50)=0.14763 |    16.990   |  2.508 |
|  0 | 0.25 |   w+(1)-w+(0.75)=0.43173  |      0      |    0   |

-----

$u^+(x)$ = $x^{0.88}$ if x $\geq$ 0

$u^-(x)$ = 2.25 * $-(-x)^{0.88}$ if x $<$ 0     (with $\lambda$ = 2.25) 

&nbsp;

$w^+(p) = \frac{p^{0.61}}{(p^{0.61}+(1-p)^{0.61})^{1/0.61}}$

$w^-(p) = \frac{p^{0.69}}{(p^{0.69}+(1-p)^{0.69})^{1/0.69}}$ 

-------


$w^+(0) = \frac{0^{0.61}}{(0^{0.61}+(1)^{0.61})^{1/0.61}}$ = 0  
$w^+(0.25) = \frac{0.25^{0.61}}{(0.25^{0.61}+(0.75)^{0.61})^{1/0.61}}$ = 0.290   
$w^+(0.50) = \frac{0.50^{0.61}}{(0.50^{0.61}+(0.50)^{0.61})^{1/0.61}}$ = 0.42064  
$w^+(0.75) = \frac{0.75^{0.61}}{(0.75^{0.61}+(0.25)^{0.61})^{1/0.61}}$ = 0.56827  
$w^+(1) = \frac{1^{0.61}}{(1^{0.61}+(0)^{0.61})^{1/0.61}}$ = 1   

0.29074 - 0 = 0.29074  
0.42064 - 0.29074 = 0.12990  
0.56827 - 0.42064 = 0.14763  
1 - 0.56827 = 0.43173 

-------

$u^+(75)$ = $75^{0.88}$ = 44.674  
$u^+(50)$ = $50^{0.88}$ = 31.268  
$u^+(25)$ = $25^{0.88}$ = 16.990  
$u^+(0)$ = $0^{0.88}$ = 0 

CPT = 12.989 + 4.062 + 2.508 + 0 = 19.559

$CE^{0.88}$ = 19.559 $\rightarrow$ CE = 29.339

EV = $\frac{1}{4}(75)+\frac{1}{4}(50)+\frac{1}{4}(25)+\frac{1}{4}(0)=37.5$  
RP = 37.5 - 29.339 = 8.161


Part B
-------
 B) (0.25, €0; 0.25, -€25; 0.25, -€50; 0.25, -€75)  

|  x  |   p  |             π             | u(x) = U(x) |  πU(x)  |  
|:---:|:----:|:-------------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
|  0  | 0.25 |   w+(0.25)-w+(0)=0.29074  |    0        |  0      |
| -25 | 0.25 | w-(0.50)-w+(0.25)=0.12990 |    -38.227  | -6.591  |
| -50 | 0.25 | w-(0.50)-w+(0.25)=0.14763 |    -70.352  | -11.289 |
| -75 | 0.25 |   w-(0.25)-w-(0)=0.29352  |   -100.516  | -29.503 |

-------

$w^-(0.75) = \frac{0.75^{0.69}}{(0.75^{0.69}+(0.25)^{0.69})^{1/0.69}}$ = 0.62640 
0.62640-0.45399= 0.17241
$u^-(-75)$ = 2.25 * $-(--75)^{0.88}$ = -100.516 

CPT = 0 + -6.591 + -11.289 + -29.503 = -47.383
$CE^{0.88}$ = -47.383 $\rightarrow$ CE = -31.909

EV = $\frac{1}{4}(0)+\frac{1}{4}(-25)+\frac{1}{4}(-50)+\frac{1}{4}(-75)= -37.50$
RP = -37.50 - -31.909 = -5.591 

Question 4
==========

Consider the prospects E = (0.5, -3000; 0.5, 4500),  F = (0.25, -6000; 0.75, 3000), G = (0.5, -1500; 0.5, 4500), and H = (0.25, -3000; 0.75, 3000).  
 
Levy and Levy (2002; Management Science) show that when asked to choose between prospects E and F, 71\% of subjects in the laboratory prefer E. In addition, while 76\% of subjects prefer to have prospect G rather prospect H. Based on these results, Levy and Levy (2002) conclude that “we reject the S-shaped [utility] function [of CPT].” Do you agree with this conclusion? Why (not)? }

--------

Using the example from the lecture slides, people can prefer E to F and G to H without violating the expectations of an s-shaped utility curve (see the graph on the following slide). The intuition is that losing x hurts more than gaining x brings pleasure. Although people should prefer 0.75 x 3000 to 0.5 x 4500, the possible loss of 6000 with probability of 0.25 hurts too much and will outweigh the extra utility from 0.75 x 3000.

$w^+(p)=w^-(p)=p^2$  
$u^+(x)=x^5$  
$u^-(x)=-2x^5$ 

------

CPT(E) = $w^-(0.5)u^-(-3000)+w^+(0.5)u^+(4500)$ 
= $0.5^2$ x (-2) x $3000^5$ + $0.5^2$ x $4500^5$ = 4.6 x $10^6$  

CPT(F) = $w^-(0.25)u^-(-6000)+w^+(0.75)u^+(3000)$
= $0.25^2$ x (-2) x $6000^5$ + $0.75^2$ x $3000^5$ = -8.35 x $10^{17}$ 

CPT(E) $>$ CPT(F) 

------------

CPT(G) = $w^-(0.5)u^-(-1500)+w^+(0.5)u^+(4500)$
= $0.5^2$ x (-2) x $1500^2$ + $0.25^2$ x $4500^5$ = 4.58 x $10^{17}$ 

CPT(H) = $w^-(0.25)u^-(3000)+w^+(0.75)u^+(3000)$
= $0.25^2$ x (-2) x $3000^5$ + $0.75^2$ x $3000^5$ = 1.06 x $10^{17}$ 

CPT(G) $>$ CPT(H) 

------

#### Marginal Utility is Dependent on Domain

![CPT utility curve over domains of losses and gains](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Valuefun.jpg)
 

-------

A second possible explanation that comes to the same conclusion that we do not agree with
the statement by Levy and Levy (2002) is the following:
Looking at the probability weighting of cumulative prospect theory, shows that small
probabilities are overweighted and moderate and large probabilities are underweighted (see the second graph below). 

![Probability weighting function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Weightingfun.jpg)

--------

Why do people prefer E over F? In prospect F there is a small probability of a very large
negative outcome. Since it is a small probability and a negative outcome, people are
pessimistic according to CPT. Prospect E on the other hand has equal moderate probabilities
and is hence preferred over a prospect with a small overweighted outcome of loosing 6000
with probability 0.25. 

The same logic holds for prospects G and H. In Prospect H there is a small probability of a
very large negative outcome. Since it is a small probability and a negative outcome, people
are pessimistic according to CPT and hence prefer prospect G over prospect H.
